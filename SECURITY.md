# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in Misskey, please report it by sending an
email to [noreply@stesan.dev](mailto:noreply@stesan.dev).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make Misskey safe for everyone.
